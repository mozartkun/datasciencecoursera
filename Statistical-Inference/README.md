In this repo, you will see files about peer assessment 1 (simulation work) and peer assessment 2 (inference work).
For simulation work, there are simulation.R, simulation.Rmd, simulation.md and simulation.html files.
For inference work, there are inference.R, inference.Rmd, inference.md and inference.html files.
Each work has respective R code, R markdown file, markdown file and html file.
I also submit pdf versions in this repo to show these results.
